In this homework assignment I took the feedback from when I first submitted my portfolio and implemented all the changes my TA made note of. To start, I renamed my repo to something more descriptive "2-responsePortfolio". I then renamed my style sheet to the standard "style.css" instead it was "main.css" before. I updated the <title> to "My Portfolio" instead of "Document". I researched more about alt tags and added them as recommeneded to all my <img> tags. Finally, I've updated the Readme and included a link to the repo found here (https://kaiwarren12.github.io/2-responsivePortfolio/)
